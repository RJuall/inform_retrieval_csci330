			Crazy Cookie Dough: One Easy Cookie Recipe with Endless Flavor Variations!					
		By Gemma Stafford | July 20, 2017 | 378   Save Recipe
			Hi Bold Bakers!
I don't know about you but I absolutely love cookies! Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies, hearty Oatmeal Raisin Cookies, rich Peanut Butter Cookies and gooey Salted Caramel Cookies…the combinations are endless! Since there are so many mouthwatering flavors I decided to create one Crazy Cookie Dough to fulfill all of those homemade cookie cravings!
WATCH MY CRAZY COOKIE DOUGH
RECIPE VIDEO
Similar to my idea for Crazy Dough, which was one bread dough that can be made into so many different sweet and savory breads, I've created one truly Crazy Cookie Dough! This dough is the absolute perfect blank canvas for all of your favorite cookie flavors! It has the perfect balance of brown sugar, white sugar, melted butter and salt. The result is beyond decadent bakery-style cookies. This means no matter which flavorings you choose to add in, this cookie is perfectly crisp around the edges and chewy gooey in the center. Why make one boring batch of the same cookie, when you can make a variety of your favorites!
From the smell that fills the house to that warm and fuzzy comfort I get from knowing I have a full cookie jar, there is just nothing like a homemade, fresh out of the oven cookie. I can't wait for you all to give the recipe a spin and make these cookies your own. Let's face it what day can't be improved by a truly delicious cookie?
Chocolate Chip Cookie
Let's start with a classic! My advice for making the BEST-EVER Chocolate Chip Cookie is to use dark chocolate that has been cut into chunks. Dark chocolate with a cocoa solid percentage of at least 72% is what you want to give you that perfect bittersweet richness.
Peanut Butter Cookie
My husband's favorite so I gotta throw this one into the mix. Use your favorite peanut butter, smooth or chunky, to mix into your Crazy Cookie Dough. For extra crunch toss in a few salted, toasted peanuts too.
Oatmeal Raisin Cookie
An oldie but a goodie, this classic cookie cannot be over looked. Using ingredients that you would normally have on hand, toss in some rolled oats and raisins to your Crazy Cookie Dough and you will be delighted with the results.
Birthday Cake Cookie
Birthday Cake is 1 of my 5 a day! Seriously, I try whenever possible to throw sprinkles into everything!! To create a Birthday Cake Cookie add some of your favorite sprinkles and white chocolate chips into your Crazy Cookie Dough and enjoy the results.
Chocolate & Hazelnut Cookie
Do you have a tub of Nutella in your cupboard? Then you are halfway there to a Chocolate and Hazelnut Cookie. Stir some Nutella into my Crazy Cookie Dough, toss in some toasted hazelnuts for good measure and BOOM! You have a Chocolate & Hazelnut Cookie.
Double Chocolate Chip Cookie
Very possibly my most favorite cookie EVER! Why? Because the results are like a brownie. Add some cocoa powder and dark chopped chocolate chunks into your Crazy Cookie Dough and enjoy the best cookie you have ever eaten!
S'more Cookie
What makes a S'mores Cookie? Marshmallows, chocolate and Graham Crackers, right? Stir all of those bad boys into my Crazy Cookie Dough and you have an instant family favorite.
Salted Caramel Cookie
To make an extra gooey, chewy cookie that has a salty kick add in some chopped caramels into my Crazy Cookie Dough, top with a pinch of sea salt and you will be halfway to heaven.

Set aside. Whisk both sugars in a large bowl and make sure to break up any large chunks. Add the melted butter and whisk vigorously for about 1 minute, until light fluffy and fully incorporated. Whisk in one egg to the sugar-butter mixture, stirring until it's fully mixed in. Scrape the sides of the bowl with your spatula. Whisk in the second egg and the vanilla and scrape the sides of bowl again. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir with the spatula to fully combined. Chill the dough for a minimum of 30 minutes to 2 hours before scooping. Using a quarter scoop measure scoop the cookie dough base into roughly 10-12 cookies. Chocolate Chip Cookie: Press your chocolate chunks into your base cookie and fold the cookie dough over itself to make sure the chocolate chunks are distributed through out Oatmeal raisin Cookie: Using your hand make a well in the center of the dough. Add in the oatmeal and the raisins. Fold the cookie dough over itself to make sure the oatmeal and raisins are distributed through out. Double Chocolate Cookie: Using your hand make a well in the center of the dough. Add in the cocoa powder and chocolate chunks. Fold the cookie dough over itself to make sure the ad-ins are distributed through out. Peanut Butter Cookie: Using your hand make a well in the center of the dough. Add in the peanut butter and chopped peanuts. Fold the cookie dough over itself to make sure the peanut butter and peanuts are distributed through out. Chocolate Hazelnut Cookie: Using your hand make a well in the center of the dough. Add in the Nutella and chopped hazelnuts. Fold the cookie dough over itself to make sure the Nutella and nuts are distributed through out. S'more Cookie: Using your hand make a well in the center of the dough. Add in the graham crackers, marshmallow and chocolate. Fold the cookie dough over itself to make sure the s'more ad-ins are distributed through out. Salted Caramel Cookie: Using your hand make a well in the center of the dough. Add in the chopped caramels. Fold the cookie dough over itself to make sure the caramel candies are distributed through out. Top with flakey sea salt. Birthday Cake Cookie: Using your hand make a well in the center of the dough. Add in sprinkles and white chocolate chips. Fold the cookie dough over itself to make sure the sprinkles and chips are distributed through out. When ready to bake preheat the oven to 375ºF (185oC). Place the cookies on a larger parchment lined cookie sheet about 4 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes until you can still see it is doughy in the center but browning around the edge. Resist the urge to bake for longer as you will over bake it and lose that gooey center. Let cool on the sheet for 5 minutes then enjoy. Store in an air tight container for up to 3 days.     Notes EGGLESS CRAZY COOKIE DOUGH: See my Egg Substitutes for Baking Chart and use condensed milk or flax seed.   3.5.3226

						Hi Gemma! I was wondering what the best type of butter was for this recipe? Salted or Unsalted butter?
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on November 25, 2017 at 3:26 am
						Hi Kelly,
I tend to use salted butter for everything. buttercream frosting is an occasional exception, but the salt level adds flavor to most baking, and chefs rely on it for all sorts of baking. Bread needs a touch of salt too, but never add yeast directly on top of salt, it will kill it!
I hope this is of help,
Gemma 🙂

						How many cookies should I put on the baking sheet? And is it also possible to only bake 1 or 2 cookies?
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on November 25, 2017 at 3:36 am
						Hi Mia,
Firstly, yes, you can bake as many as you like at one time.
There are a few important things to remember. Chilling the dough is important, it keeps the dough in shape, and prevents it spreading.
If you roll the dough into a sausage shape, wrap it well in cling film, and chill it, you will be able to slice it into the portions you wish to bake, re-wrap it for another time. you can freeze it too!
You need to leave a little space between the cookies on the pan, about an inch should do it.
I hope this helps,
Gemma 🙂

						Hi Gemma
Thank you so much for this amazing recipe. I'd like to try it out this weekend, but I have a couple of questions, if you could help me out please.
1) I don't get brown sugar where I live, so alternatively -- should I use regular castor sugar or Demarara?
2) What is the shelf life for these cookies, chocolate chip ones in particular. I will be storing them in an airtight jar.
3) Can the measurements be multiplied for a larger batch, say 2 times for 20 cookies.      
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on November 23, 2017 at 9:29 am
						Hi Amrita!
1) yes, you can use regular white sugar or make your own using my How to Make Brown Sugar recipe.
2) You can store them for around 3 days in an airtight container
3) yes, just multiply the ingredients by 2. I hope you enjoy!

						You're a legend! Unfortunately, it's a bit tough getting treacle in India for the brown sugar recipe; but I'm going to try it with white sugar. Thank you so much. Will post pictures!!

						Hi Gemma,
I am really a big fan of yours...been trying to recreate your recipes..I tried this one but i didn't actually followed the recipe...instead of putting white sugar I only put brown sugar and I lessened the ratio...I didn't freeze the dpugh before scooping as well ...but in the end I still was able to pull the recipe well..thanks for the recipe and for the tips in your youtube channel 🙂

						It's me again Gemma:
I just watched "The British Baking Show" and it called for strong white flour as well as plain flour. Is strong white the same as bread flour and plain  the same as all-purpose?
Karen
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on November 19, 2017 at 8:48 am
						Haha! Karen, it is!
All the different names for the same thing! In Ireland we have one called Cream flour! This is more like a pastry flour.
All-Purpose Flour/Plain Flour is your go-to kind of everyday flour, with a protein content that can range from 9 -- 12%. Unbleached flour tends to have a higher protein content, and it is definitely a better choice compared to bleached. The gluten content varies with the harvest season, region of production, freshness, and many other factors.
Bread Flour/Strong Flour is a high gluten flour which contains about 13% protein, and it is, of course, best for bread.
Pastry Flour/cream Flour is a finer, lower gluten kind of flour that is best suited for sweet baked goods like cakes and cookies. It has a very soft texture.
Cake Flour is even finer and lower in gluten than pastry flour. It might be good for baked goods that need an especially soft and fluffy texture and do not need to withstand a long proofing process.
Self-raising Flour already contains the raising agent. should just be left in the shelf where it stands. If you want great results in baking, learn how to use and measure your own yeast and baking powders.
So, that is how I explain it!
Thanks for being in touch, Bake Off is great!
Gemma 🙂

						Hi Gemma I just made these today and although the taste was good, the cookies didn't come as flat like yours 🙁 I've always wanted to make cookies that'll taste like the bakery ones and I want them to look flat but mine was puffy and tasted cake-y...do you know what could've been wrong? I followed the exact recipe..also, mine tasted like the chips ahoys cookies and I wasn't really looking for that texture 😬
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on November 18, 2017 at 6:11 am
						Hi Ashley,
It sounds like a measurement problem. Perhaps a bit too much flour, if all of the other ingredients were the same.
did you change the fat/butter, or sugars? All of these ingredients have their place in this or any recipe.
Other than that I really am mystified. Do try it again,
Gemma 🙂
		Reply
			Ashley on November 18, 2017 at 2:24 pm
						Hi Gemma, thanks for the fast reply! No I didn't not change anything, I made everything with the exact same measurements as yours..and I also chilled my dough for 2 hours. Maybe it's because of the chilling time..how long did you chill your dough?
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on November 19, 2017 at 8:33 am
						Hi Ashley,
Two hours should be more than enough for this, I usually just give it 30 mins or so.
I think it may be your flour so. Flour in different places behaves in different ways, depending on how, where, when and type of grain milled. I think you could add a little extra flour, to give the consistency you like. add 1/2 extra cup of flour, or reduce the white sugar, there is a bit of flexibility in this recipe.
I hope this helps,
Gemma 🙂

			Ashley on November 19, 2017 at 5:50 pm
						I used Gold Medal all purpose flour so it shouldn't be that bad 😙 I thought about it and I thought the problem could be because I used 1 tbsp scoop of dough. In the video you said to use 1/4 cup scoop measure cup and I guess it's a science thing where if there's a bigger cookie dough, it is able to spread out during baking. That could be why lol. Anyways, I really want to give this another try and I really hope they'll be flat!
			Gemma Stafford on November 20, 2017 at 1:52 am
						Hi Ashley,
Not sure about it. Perhaps the butter too, I am a little mystified.
Carry on baking!

						Hi Gemma
I am new her and i love how you cook and bake it looks so easy
I am from belgium so my englisch is not so good
So my question is can i use coconut blossom sugar and rice sugar
Instead of white and brown sugar
Thank you in advance
Noemie
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on November 18, 2017 at 9:26 am
						Hi Noemie,
It is good to have you with us in Belgium.
I think that the coconut sugar will work well for you. It will caramelize like regular sugar, and this matters for  I am not familiar with rice sugar. I have not come across that one.
I hope this is of help,
Gemma 🙂

						Hi.
Can I try it without eggs.
What does eggs make to this recipe?
What is the substitute for egg.
Thanks
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on November 17, 2017 at 2:43 am
						Hi there,
The egg in this recipe binds it, and holds the cookie together, along with the sugars.
Condensed milk or flax seed should work for these cookies. I would reduce the sugar if you use condensed milk.
Flax seed/chia seek eggs are a great ingredient, they can raise the fat level in the bake, so you may need to run a little experiment.
Do let us know what you find,
Gemma 🙂

			Mary on November 9, 2017 at 8:57 am
						Hi Gemma. Thanks for this recipe. I discovered however that my cookies had a metallic taste (due to the baking soda I believe).  I followed your recipe (using the weights you provided although I reduced the white sugar by 30g) and used exactly 1 leveled teaspoon of the soda (with no lumps). Could the white sugar reduction be the reason for this? I'm a bit disappointed 😥
Please advise on what I could do next time.
Cheers.
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on November 10, 2017 at 1:48 am
						Hi Mary,
The bicarbonate of soda/baking soda can affect the taste, but it adds a crispness to the cookies as it interacts with the sugars. I think if you reduce the sugar, you could also reduce the soda, perhaps to 1/4 tsp. It is interesting that such a small change can change results, but it can, though not always.
Do try it again, It will not be a fail.
Thank you for being in touch,
Gemma 🙂

						Hi Gemma. Both my husband and my daughter are celiac. Do you have any suggestions on how to make this cookie recipe gluten-free?
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on November 5, 2017 at 3:23 am
						Hi Wendy,
There are a few GF recipes here (https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/category/recipes/dietary-preferences/gluten-free/)  though it is not my specialty, it is an area that I focus on from time to time.
Many recipes do not rely on gluten, so a good all purpose GF flour will work well in most. It is probable that your kitchen is already a gluten free zone, so it iwll be possible to adapt many recipes safely.
the big issue for celiacs is yeasted dough, as this really requires gluten, or an alternative, to work well. There are some 'strong' GF flours available too, and plenty advice online from specialists in this area.
Thank you for being here with us,
Gemma 🙂

						Hi Gemma, I was wondering, if adding  pureed Pumpkin and dried cranberry or pureed Banana and raisins, would this change the texture of the dough since the pumpkin or banana is more liquid than solid? The cooking times would be the same? Thank you for all the great recipies.
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on November 4, 2017 at 4:26 am
						Hi Geraldine,
Banana tends to bind, so I think I would not puree it, but chop it up finely.
The pumpkin, if is dry enough should not cause a problem. Both are worth a try, just make a test batch, and have fun!

						I have searched years for a crispy edge chewy center cookie. These came out perfect! I got 17 very large cookies.  I chopped fun size candy bars and they are delicious.  I followed the recipe as written.  Thank you for sharing. This will be my go to cookie dough!

			Gemma Stafford on November 3, 2017 at 2:29 am
						Hi Brenda,
Good, I am happy that this is  good for you. To stop the cookies spreading so much you can do one of two things:
1. add a little extra flour
2. Place the shaped cookies in the fridge for about 20 mins before baking.
I hope this is of help,
Gemma 🙂

						Dear Gemma, 
I have an electric oven with confectionery fan.
(1) I wonder if i want to bake this cookie, which heat should i use?
The heat i ment is wether top, bottom or top+bottom heat?
(2) Why does many baking recipe i see on the net usually do not specify that top bottom heat?
(3) if a recipe need top+bottom heat. Can i change it to bake with only top only or bottom only heat?
(4) Gemma can you please share with me which recipes that can be baked with just top only or bottom only heat?
Ps. I can not use both top+bottom heat simultaneously cos of not enough electricity 😀
Goh

			Gemma Stafford on November 2, 2017 at 5:38 am
						Hi there,
Ah! this is an issue!
I think you mean a convection oven! This needs to be both the top and bottom elements to work, unless your instructions tell you something different.
The top element alone will normally be used for grilling in an OTG. The bottom one will be more successful for you for baking, but generally when you select the temperature, the oven decides which to engage, it depends on your brand.
I do hope this is of help,
Gemma 🙂

Reduce just the white sugar. I think you can do this by about 1/2. Try it? it will be an experiment, but I think it will be good,

						Hi there,
A microwave with a convection oven is a great thing!
You use the oven as you would any convection oven, selecting that mode only. Then it is the same 180C/350F for most baking. This is like the magic baking temperature, sometimes it changes, but not too often,

						What I do not understand Sakina, is why it is liquidy? It can only be so if you are adding too much liquid, or not enough flour.

 topped with a cookie that has white chocolate chips, coconut and chopped dates. I wish I knew how to put pictures on here. And smells. You've GOT to try them.  You've already gained weight by reading this. ha ha.  What's your favorite brand of tea? (to go with the cookies of course)  Karen

There is a tradition in Ireland, that everybody must drink tea, and you probably know that. However, no matter which tea you have at home, when you travel, and people send you 'food' parcels, Barry's Tea is a must. Even the immigration people at the airports around the world will ask Irish visitors 'did you bring the Barry's?'
So, that has to be the answer for me! Other people will have a different response, interesting question,

						Hi Gemma, greetings !
I made bread out of this crazy cookie dough batter. 😀
I had over mixed the dough, and there were these long gluten strands. I had added the flour first and then the flax eggs. I rested the overmixed dough and baked them in a loaf tin and they turned out amazing ! Just like the Irish soda bread ! But the sweet version of it.
   It was quite a happy mistake. My friends and I enjoyed it with a curry of roasted tomatoes, grated carrots and sautéed onions. It was yum !

						Hi Gemma
This is Addalina,
I am going to Big Bear next weekend with my sister and her bf to go stay in his cabin...and I was planning on baking some of your recipes like the crazy cookie dough, cinnamon rolls etc...but since it is a higher altitude than here in San Diego, what do I have to change to the recipe?
I know that the baking is different up in the mountain areas, could you help me out?

		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on October 19, 2017 at 5:28 am
						Hi Addalina,
The problem with high altitude baking is that it changes more than one thing!
The oven temperature needs to be adjusted upwards by about 25C, the baking powder reduced and the liquids increased.
There are a number of charts/instructions etc online, I would be repeating what they say. Do google it, for each type of recipe. Alternatively, bake at home, freeze, and refresh when you get there, so that you avoid the stress. Have fun, and enjoy the experience, that is what is important!

						I tried these and they did not work out at all. I made them as Double Chocolate, and they tasted like regular chocolate chip even though I added the cocoa. 2 teaspoons wasn't near enough! They weren't dark at all. And the cookies were WAY to big, hardly making any. I followed everything exactly. And only 1 teaspoon of chocolate chips was hardly ANY! Was this a typo? I did give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the cookie part itself was very tasty :), although it wasn't at all what I wanted.

						Hi Julia,
The mixes are meant to be for one cookie, not a batch, do you think this is what went wrong?
Did you change anything in the recipe, such as the butter?
Flour behaves differently in different places too, some more absorbent than others. Chilling the dough before you bake it also helps to keep in shape.
Am I finding the issue?

These cookies are delightful (I made chocolate chip and oatmeal and raisins) and they came out PERFECTLY!
I added about a half teaspoon of baking powder to the dough because I was worried that the cookies would spread out too thin. And that gave me absolutely splendid cookies.

						Hey Gemma, I have always followed BBB for these wonderful versatile recipes. I'm going to try these cookies today or tomorrow and was wondering if I could use whole wheat flour to make it a tad bit healthier? Also, we get plain white flour (Maida) very commonly here, do you think the recipe would turn out differently or the result won't be what we want at all if I changed either of the things? Do you think I'll have to add more baking powder to it if I use either Plain white flour (Maida) or wheat flour?
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on October 18, 2017 at 4:00 am
						Hi there,
good question! Others have use wholemeal flour for these, and yes, it does change the result. I think I would try it 1/2 white and 1/2 wholemeal to start, and use a finely ground one too. You will need to keep an eye on the texture, as the wholemeal absorbs liquids and fats differently to white. You may need a little extra.
Try it, it will not be an epic fail!

						Hey Gemma! I tried it and they turned out awesome! I didn't make them as gigantic as the ones in the video as I got near about 30 cookies. I reduced the amount of sugar that went in as well as the type of flour. For 375g of flour I used 2 60ml cups and 2 125ml cups out of which only 1 60ml cup of the refined flour. They turned out exactly how you said they would, crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside. 💕💕

						Hi Anuala,
Good question!
Take a spoon, lift the amount of batter you wish to use, and very lightly roll it between your palms, you will get a little ball. Place on the tray, an press it gently with your finger to slightly flatten, chill, and bake!
That is a very usefull technique for any cookies really, and you get a uniform finish too,

						Shruthi, what would I do without you. You really are learning all sorts of techniques, and also developing a great intelligence around baking, you know what will rescue things, and this is really the science of baking, so very well done!
I am happy that the Whoopie pies worked for you, they are tricky, particularly without a special pan, but a little batter in the bottom of a cupcake pan can do it too.
The cake batter rescue is a touch confusing, as you would not get away with freezing the batter for a sponge cake, though it will work for a pastry. I am slow to publish that one, as it may sound like it is coming from me, and I cannot stand over it. The rest of course are a great help, so thank you, and keep on giving us the benefit of your experience,

			Shruthi Achut on October 26, 2017 at 10:29 am
						Hi Gemma, greetings !
Thank you for the reply. The whoopie pies, I baked them on a baking tray lined with parchment. As for the overmixed cake batter, all I did was to add a lot of extra flour and freeze rock solid. Then shred the dough to fine crumbs in the food processor. I wanted to get it to resemble the crumbs when making your vanilla birthday cake recipe. It did work for me for a sponge cake. Because freezing weakens the gluten bonds and shredding the dough in the frozen state breaks those bonds. Then coat it with fat and the crumbs are protected from reforming the gluten.

						Hi Cheryl,
If you cut back the white sugar a bit, you will get a less thin cookie. Increasing the flour a little will change this too. Flour in different locations absorbs liquids in different ways, depending on which strain of wheat, and how, where and even when it is milled. Try this for a different result,

						Hi Regina,
That is too bad. Refrigerating the dough helps, as it keeps it in shape when it is setting up in the oven.
You can add a little extra flour too, as flour also behaves differently in different places.

						Hi Brian,
Here is a recipe for snickerdoodle (https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/new-single-serving-cookies/). It is also an easy recipe, so have a go at it!
Cream of tartar is an acid ingredient, a bi-product of the wine making industry, from grapes. This is an acid ingredient, which balances with the alkaline of bicarbonate of soda, to raise the bake. Baking powder is exactly this, but in a balanced formula.
Understanding the science of baking is helpful to us, as we can then figure out how to change a recipe to suit. buttermilk and yogurt are also acid ingredients, and often are used with soda to leaven/raise a bake. This is just by way of an fyi!

     What I would like to know is how much of these additives would I put if the whole recipe is dedicated to just one version? I know some you just add what looks good like peanuts or choc chips but some things can really change up a recipe like peanut butter or coco powder.
    It would be very appreciated for a full recipe of single flavor

						I made these today and to be honest I usually have a very sweet tooth but even these were too sweet for me.  A friend suggested using banana instead of sugar, would you have any recommendations to do this.
Also my mother in law tasted one and she was surprised that salt would be an ingredient as she bakes all the time and usually does not use salt if she is baking something sweet.  I also saw some where else that wrapping the mixture in cling wrap is something that people do, is this beneficial to the final outcome?
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on October 2, 2017 at 1:46 am
						Hi Teresa,
You can adjust the sugar in this cookie, easily really. The brown sugar adds moisture, and a caramel note, so perhaps reduce the white! I have know this to be removed, and today in a comment the sugars were substituted with date crystals. Wrapping the cookie dough is a regular thing here on BBB, sausage shape, refrigerate, slice and pop on the baking tray. This will firm up the dough, and keep the cookies from spreading too far.
as a professional chef I have always used salt in baking, it enhances the flavor. If I use salted butter I tend to use less salt, or no salt, it really is a choice.
So! I say experiment with this recipe, or take a look at other cookie recipes here on the website. Cookies are really forgiving, they need sufficient fat and sugar to hold them together, other than that adjust as you wish, it will be ok.

			Gemma Stafford on September 29, 2017 at 3:13 am
						Hi Emily,
generally you make, add the flavors, chill and bake!
If you reduce the white sugar a little, by about 1 tablespoon, you should get a deeper bake too. A touch more flour may help too. Flor in different places behaves in different ways, absorbing liquids differently. A little extra may solve this for you,
Gemma 🙂

Thanks so much for your recipe, I'm sure I'm on the right track for my dream cookies with it, but something is slightly off. I followed it to the letter as far as I know, but I can't get the kind of crispy edges/top that looks so good on the pictures. My cookies are always more cakey, and if I leave them more on the oven they start to burn. Any suggestions?
		Reply
			Gemma Stafford on September 27, 2017 at 1:26 am
						Hi Catalina,
When you say 'to the letter' does this mean that you did not substitute any of the ingredients?
If you did not then this may be something to do with the oven thermostat. does the oven usually bake evenly, and according to recipe give the expected result?
You may need to bake at a slightly lower temperature for longer, but it is difficult to see how you go from under-baked to burned, without going through the crisp stage. You may just need to watch the baking, after the first ten minutes or so, and motitor until you are happy with the result. I think all will be well,
Gemma 🙂

						What a lovely Treat!  We really enjoyed the first batch that I baked yesterday. I made some double chocolate cookies and they flew off the counter as soon as they were ready to eat. Only a few was left over and I put it in a sealed container and in the pantry, so after work today when I came home I enjoyed one with a nice cuppa. I'm quite surprised  that they are kind of soft as I thought they probably would firm up and become more like a hard cookie. Are they supposed to be soft or did I do something Wrong?  It's still nice, sweet and tasty.

						Hi Jo,
These do tend to be a bit chewy. If you reduce the sugar they will firm up a bit more, if this is what you like.

						Made it and they were delicious. I like the sweetness but my husband prefers less sweet.  Do I reduce the white or brown sugar? By how much? Will it change the texture and appearance of the cookie? Because I hope not since I love them as they are.

						Hi Maria,
Another great question today. These are sweet, but the sugar can indeed be reduced, and by as much as 1/2. cut out the white sugar, as the brown adds a little moisture to the bake. Be prepared for a different result, the cookie will most likely be a little thicker, but it will be good!
Gemma 🙂

						I just followed this recipe and made chocolate chip cookies. However, it was bad.
I have many questions, its probably my fault  that the cookies came out bad considering the review for your cookies is really high.
Firstly, its weird to me why is your conversion from cups to gram all different from what i find googling.  
From google, 1 cup of sugar should be 200grams, so why is your brown sugar 300grams instead of 250grams and sugar is 180grams instead of 150grams?
I started off with heating the butter, made it all melt, then i poured the butter into a bowl. Mixed 300grams of brown sugar and 180grams of  white sugar and whisked them. Afterwards i realised i ran out of flour, went off to get some flour,  meanwhile i kept my sugar/butter mix in the fridge and came back around 30minutes later. 
Measured and poured 375grams of flour into another bowl, added 1 teaspoon of Crude salt instead of normal salt, 1 teaspoon of baking soda and mixed them. 
Back to the butter mix, i added 2 eggs and 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and mixed them.
Afterwards, i added the flour mix into the butter mix and whisked them together. Added some chocolate chips and whisked them too.
Refrigerated them for slightly more than 2 hours.
Took them out and made them slightly bigger than 1 teaspoon, cooked them in my oven (model 'to 1919rc' with the cooking light thing at top and bottom on and convection off) in different batches, 160° c for 20mins, 170° c for 20mins and 180° c for 15mins. I let them all cool for 5mins and tasted them.
 First 2 batches were hard. 160° c was horrendous. 170° c was slightly ok. 180° c was quite soft after cooling, but i guess it was really thick? It felt slightly difficult to eat through because of the 'thickness' i guess.
I baked the 160° c first for 15mins but it looked undercooked, so i added 5 more mins. Same thing for 170° c. 
They all looked 'raw' when taking out of the oven. 
Taste seems fine( i can't get the scent out of the cookie), about the same as all my other attempt with other recipes. I really can't get the taste out, you have to really taste it to get any flavors.
Keeping the rest in the refrigerator until tomorrow to cook. 
Kindly give me some pointers, sorry for the long comment. Also sorry if this is abit confusing. I'm real dumb.
Also, seeing comments above, 180° c for 12mins seem too less? Whenever i baked them in this temperature, they all feel too undercooked.
Thanks for your recipe Gemma!

						Hi Henry,
So first off i'm sure it was just a little mistake that can be easily fixed. 
First off, yes you will see different conversions out there as people do theres differently. Trust me as a person from Europe, mine is right. Check it out here https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/weight-conversion-chart/
Did you use my measurements or did you change them to the measurement you found online?

						Hello,
I followed your measurements. Do you know what is the science behind getting the flavor out? I think the cookies i made taste fine, but texture is bad and can't really get the taste out.

						Hi Jun,
Perhaps this recipe is not for you! Try these cookies, different flavors and textures to the crazy dough recipe. There are a number of great cookie recipes here on the website for you to try, the giant single serve cookies are great too. (https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/?s=Chocolate+chip+cookies) take a look at these ones too, have fun, it is a learning curve,
Gemma 🙂

						Hi Gemma,
I wasn't necessarily referring to only your cookies when i said the texture of the cookies i baked were bad.
All my attempts on cookies felt less like a real cookie but somewhat soft, no crisp. 
Using a convection oven (model to1919rc) how would you recommend me to bake it?
Also, is using totally melted butter fine? I usually just heat the butter until it all melts.
			Gemma Stafford on September 29, 2017 at 2:44 am
						Hi Jun,
Cookies in the US are generally soft, chewy. European style biscuits/cookies tend to be crisp.
Do try the giant single serve ones, they tend to be crisp, depending on how long you bake them.
180C/350F is the magic temperature for most baking. Baking a little longer will give you a crisper result too.
Melting the butter is fine, but do firm up the dough in the fridge before baking, this also helps,
Gemma 🙂

						Sorry, to add on. I'm looking at your GIANT Single-Serving cookies.
The first 'Classic Chocolate Chip Cookie' has the texture I want, my texture of cookies usually came out as the 'Buttery Soft Sugar Cookie'. I guess you call it soft sugar cookie? I want a crispy one.
When you say butter, do you mean unsalted?
Because 2 of the cookies you just said salted, and 3rd you specified unsalted.
I'm going to try your 3 GIANT cookies.

						Hello. First of all amazing recipe.  I baked the cookie and their taste was lovely but I had some trouble my dough was kind of sticky and my cookies were not baked underneath. Where did I go wrong?
Also my microwave has temperature upto 180°C so should i still give 10-12 mins? And can I use normal paper like from a dairy?

						Hi Areeba,
It sounds like the mode of baking you used for this bake was off.
did you change the recipe in any way? Do you know how to operate your oven properly?
You should be selecting convection mode 180C. No microwaves, just heat. You can bake these on a buttered tray, or buttered grease proof paper if you do not have baking paper.
If you dough feels a little sticky, resting it in the fridge for a few minutes will firm it up. Go back to the recipe to make sure you have it right.
I hope this helps,
Gemma 🙂

						I just made these; delicious! I added the Nutella & 1/2 bag chocolate chips. The cookies are flat, but are the perfect blend of crunchy edges & chewy centers. Thank you!!!!

						Hi heather,
That is great! If you refrigerate the dough prior to baking it should not be so flat! Good though, I am happy to hear this,
Gemma 🙂

						Been using this basic recipe for a chocolate chip cookie in a mug for a while and lately, I've got a new flavor that is just out of this world- white chocolate, crushed macadamia nuts, and diced strawberries. I'd strongly recommend trying it. I'm sure you will love it too.

						Hi Nancy,
You are a genius! Thank you for this, it will be an inspiration for other Bold Bakers,
Gemma 🙂

						Nancy, I too have the same combination but am allergic to strawberries. Try it with crushed macadamia nuts, white chocolate chips, coconut and chopped dates. Heavenly with a cup of tea
