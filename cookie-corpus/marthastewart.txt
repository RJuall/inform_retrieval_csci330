              Lining the pan isn't busywork; it makes it easy to remove the brownies.

    Ingredients  
                    8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, plus more for pan                  
                    1 cup all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled                  
                    1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder                  
                    1/2 teaspoon baking powder                  
                    1/2 teaspoon salt                  
                    1 cup semisweet chocolate chips                  
                    8 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, chopped                  
                    1 1/4 cups sugar                  
                    3 large eggs                  
    Directions  
                                  1.
              Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Brush a 9-inch square baking pan with butter. Line bottom and two sides with a strip of parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the two sides. Butter paper, and set pan aside. In a small bowl, whisk flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt; set aside.            
                                  2.
              Place butter and chocolate in a large heat-proof bowl set over (not in) a saucepan of gently simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally, until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes; remove bowl from pan. Add sugar; mix to combine. Add eggs, and mix to combine. Add flour mixture; mix just until moistened (do not overmix). Add chocolate chips. Transfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top.            
                                  3.
              Bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in pan for 30 minutes. Using paper overhang, lift brownies out of pan; transfer to a rack to cool completely (still on paper). On a cutting board, using a dampened serrated knife, cut into 16 squares. Store in an airtight container at room temperature, up to 2 days.

        Great recipe! Very thick and substantial brownie that is heavy on chocolate. Check early. Mine were done between 40-45 min.

        I am a professional, freelance baker, and this is one of my most-ordered recipes: my clients LOVE them. I read the rest of the reviews, and I don't find these to be dry AT ALL: in fact, they are so fudgy and moist that they are too rich for me!
Other bakers: try baking them for 45 minutes; also, I don't know if this makes a difference, but I use 9-12 oz. of chocolate chips instead of 8 oz (the clients who order these are choco-holics!)

        This recipe was terrible. very dry and very crumbly. It had a nice chocolate flavor but it just fell apart every where and did not have a nice texture. I would not recommend this recipe

        I've made brownies from scratch many times and definitely prefer them over the box method. However, this recipe disappointed me as it was too crumbly and dry. On the plus side, the brownies had a good flavor and there were no leftovers, but I just don't like brownie crumbs all over the place. I'm sorry to say that I don't recommend this recipe.

        I don't know how many times I have tried to make brownies from scratch only to throw it all away because the results were far from good. However, yesterday I tried this recipe, and the result was perfectly moist, great textured brownies with a great taste. I absolutely loved it, and my family too. Thanks!

        I tried this recipe yesterday and it was an absolute success!! It's delicious and I will certainly do it again! You should control the cooking time though, I remove mine from the oven before the 50 min recommended, otherwise it would end up overcooked.
