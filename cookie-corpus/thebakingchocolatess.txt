And now...Are you ready for some 'Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies' that taste out of this world? 
Here's a video how!
 
But Wait!  Just a couple of pointers before you start! 🙂
You must follow the directions to a 'T'.  I read the comments on Williams Sonoma Taste and some of the issues were flat cookies and too many chocolate chips, so I did decrease the chocolate chips 1/4 cup for this recipe, which are still chocked full of chocolate chips.  Ghirardelli Chocolate Chips. 🙂
And, secondly to avoid ugly, flat cookies, be sure your butter is room temperature (not melted or even softened), and use a cooler dough vs. warm dough. Just pop it in the refrigerator a bit before baking if it feels warm.  
These sweet 'perfect' cookies are completely buttery, chewy, thick and chocked full of rich, semi-sweet chocolate chips.  They are a chocolate chip cookie lover's dream!
 
The recipe is simple and it's probably my all-time favorite chocolate chip recipe of all time.  If you try them, you might decide this is your go-to chocolate chip cookie too!   Let me know!

	Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies
		These perfect cookies are buttery, chewy, thick and chocked full of rich, semi-sweet chocolate chips. Absolutely divine!	
			 Prep Time 10 minutes		
			 Author Kim Lange
		Ingredients
										1 1/2
															cups
										all-purpose flour
										see notes below
										1
															teaspoon
										baking soda
										1/2
															teaspoon
										salt
										1/2
															cup
										unsalted butter
										see notes below, room temperature
										1/2
															cup
										firmly packed light brown sugar
										6
															tablespoons
										granulated sugar
										1
															large egg
										1
															teaspoon
										vanilla extract
										2 1/4
															cups
										semisweet chocolate chips
										I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet
		Instructions
										Preheat the oven to 350°F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or spray with non-stick spray..
										In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking soda and salt together.
										In another large bowl, using an electric mixer at medium speed, beat together the butter, and sugars about 2 minutes and is smooth.
										Add the egg and vanilla and mix on low speed until mixed in.
										Gradually add the flour mixture and mix in until just incorporated. Do not keep mixing - do not overmix.
										Add chocolate chips and stir with a wooden spoon, again no overmixing, just until incorporated.
										Chill dough if dough is warm.
										Using a small or large ice cream scoop or heaping tablespoon, drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, 6 to 8 per pan, depending on size you are making.
										Bake the cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until the bottoms and edges are lightly browned and the tops feel firm when lightly touched,
										Small cookies bake 8-10 minutes
										Large cookies bake 10-13 minutes.
										Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely.
										Makes 15 - 30 cookies depending on size.
		Recipe Notes
		Butter Tips:  To avoid flat cookies: Be sure your butter is room temp (not melted or even softened), and try using cold/chilled dough if dough is warm: Just put it in the refrigerator to chill before baking.Flour Tips: Don't over-mix cookie batter especially after the flour is added and add it gradually.Make sure your baking soda is not expired.

			This recipe looks so delicious, I can't wait to test it out! You can never have too many cookie recipes under your belt, especially if they're solid go-to's! I'm always looking for ones loaded with chocolate chips, (the best kind obviously). I don't think a lot of people realize how much of a difference letting your dough chill and not over mixing help improve your cookies! TOTALLY worth it! 🙂 Thank you for sharing!

				Amanda says

			Hi,
Can the recipe be easily doubled or tripled?
				ChocolaTess says			
			September 19, 2015 at 1:57 pm		
			Hi Amanda!  I think you could.  I would make the cookie dough doesn't get too warm setting out, or the cookies won't set up.  Hope you love them! 🙂  Thanks for stopping by.

				Kerry says			
			October 6, 2015 at 11:48 pm		
			Are you able to use margarine instead of butter?
				ChocolaTess says			
			October 7, 2015 at 12:37 pm		
			Kerry,
Margarine has greater shortening power than butter, containing milk solids. You can substitute margarine for butter but the cookies will probably run all over the place from what I've learned.  If you try it and it works, let us all know!  Good luck! 🙂
				Sindhiya says			
			October 8, 2015 at 8:34 pm		
			These cookies look amazing!!! I don't know which one is pulling me harder, the meting gooey chocolate chips or the wonderful golden brown colour or the thickness of the cookie..... I can hardly wait to get these done 🙂
				ChocolaTess says			
			October 8, 2015 at 11:22 pm		
			Thank you Sindhiya!  I hope you enjoy them! 🙂
				Sue says			
			October 9, 2015 at 12:15 pm		
			Hi!
Thanks for the recipe!
Made half of the amount and still got 16 quite big cookies, but it took over 20 minutes before they even started to feel firm when lightly touched. I never know when I should get these cookies out of the oven because this time I waited too long and they're now crisp, but they do taste really good 🙂
				Kayla says			
			October 11, 2015 at 10:44 am		
			I just made these last night and they were absolutely perfect. This morning I ate one had had been left out and it was still really squishy and sweet and just delicious haha the only thing I changed was that I browned the butter and I chilled the dough for multiple hours
				ChocolaTess says			
			October 11, 2015 at 8:10 pm		
			I'm so glad you enjoyed them Sue! 🙂
				Nikki says			
			November 29, 2015 at 5:26 pm		
			I cooked these for 10 minutes and after cooling they where a little crunchy. Next time i will check after 6 minutes. The taste is good.
				ChocolaTess says			
			December 5, 2015 at 1:22 am		
			Glad you enjoyed them Nikki!  🙂
				LYDIA says			
			December 30, 2015 at 1:25 pm		
			Do these need to adapted for high altitude? Like Utah?
				ChocolaTess says			
			January 1, 2016 at 6:57 pm		
			Lydia, I am not familiar with high altitude baking.  🙁  I'm sure you could google it and see if baking chocolate chip cookiess at high altitude needs adjusting. Sorry and good luck dear!
				Sarah says

			Oh my! These are so good! My new go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. Thanks!

				Barbara Forry says			
			January 14, 2016 at 9:54 am		
			They look fabulous, but every time I have used the Ghiradelli chocolate my cookies always fall apart when I go to take them off the cookie sheets, Please let me know what I am doing wrong.  Thanks!
				ChocolaTess says			
			January 14, 2016 at 11:09 am		
			Barb, Are you letting these cool completely on the baking sheet before removing them?  They will fall apart if you don't...Hope that helps?
				Sandra says			
			January 20, 2016 at 2:33 pm		
			I didn't love this recipe.  I followed directions with exception of less chocolate chips.  Made 16 big cookies and baked for 10 minutes and they came out burnt.  I just don't care for cookies made mostly with brown sugar.  They turn out dark and crunchy.   I had to toss them!  Very disappointed.  Will stick to nestles toll house tried and true!!!
				aj says			
			February 7, 2016 at 5:46 pm		
			Hi when I tried the recipe the dough came out dry...not sure what I missed.
				ChocolaTess says			
			February 8, 2016 at 3:48 pm		
			Not sure if you overbaked or added too much flour?
				lOrrie Kay says

			I used your recipe here for chocolate chips the other day for my niece's birthday party. I'm very picky about my cookies and have been on a search for the perfect recipe for a while now. I needed to make these on the fly and am so glad I came across your recipe. I chose it because of how loaded with chocolate chips they were. While it isn't what I've been searching for exactly in a chocolate chip cookie (I've actually been trying to find one like my great aunt used to make when I was a little girl), these were truly amazing!! Hands-down the best recipe I've come across yet! I wasn't aware of chilling dough and the butter being at room temperature, so the fact that you put those little helpful hints up there I feel like made a huge impact. Literally everyone at the party LOVE these cookies and I already shared your recipe with many of them because they wouldn't let me go without it. The only thing I had to do was bake them 17-20 minutes because they were quite large, but I still got about 18 cookies from each batch. I loved the size, texture, chewiness and richness of each one. Thank you so much for sharing this with us!!!
				ChocolaTess says			
			March 23, 2016 at 12:23 pm		
			Amanda I'm soooo so glad you enjoyed them!  Thanks for passing the recipe on!  That was so sweet of you! 🙂
				Susan says			
			March 24, 2016 at 4:10 pm		
			Can I somehow add oatmeal into these?? I think that would be even better than they already are! Just not sure how to do that? Decrease flour? Thanks!!
Susan
				EDEN PASSANTE says			
			March 24, 2016 at 7:24 pm		
			THESE LOOK SO GOOEY AND DELICIOUS! JUST HOW I LIKE THEM!! MUST MAKE THESE ASAP!
				ChocolaTess says			
			March 24, 2016 at 8:57 pm		
			Hi Susan, love that idea. I'm sure it's possible. Maybe just switch out like a 1/2 cup or 3/4 cup of old-fashioned oatmeal with the the same measurements of flour? I would love to know how they turn out! 🙂
				ChocolaTess says			
			March 24, 2016 at 8:58 pm		
			Thank you Eden! Gooey is always good in my book!  Thanks so much for stopping by and hope you enjoy!
				Amy says

			As yummy as the cookies probably are, this post was far too long. The multiple page clicks were totally unnecessary. I know it's your job, and you're trying to make money. I totally get that. But, for the average busy mom with littles, we just don't have time for that. Not for a cookie recipe. Cookies look delish, pictures were stunning!  Just giving my 2c on the page click thing.
				Sherri says			
			March 31, 2016 at 7:01 pm		
			These cookies are life changing. My boyfriend and a friend absolutely love them. Thank you so much for sharing!
				ChocolaTess says			
			March 31, 2016 at 8:15 pm		
			Thank you so much Sherri!!! I am so happy to hear that! 🙂
				Sherreen says			
			April 3, 2016 at 10:34 am		
			I'm about to make these for the second time, I followed the recipie to the tee, with one exception, I used the whole bag of chips.. And OMG, it was delicious! This is by far my favorite recipie for chocolate chip cookies!
				ChocolaTess says			
			April 3, 2016 at 3:18 pm		
			Sweet Sherreen! 🙂 I think it's great you made that one exception!  Brilliant!! 🙂
				Teresa says			
			April 9, 2016 at 5:21 pm		
			I just thought I'd let you know that I've made these 3 times now and they're the best I've ever had. My husband has begged me not to misplace this recipe as I've been known to do at times. I'm baking a big batch to take to work tomorrow. I thought I'd spread the cheer.
Thank you.
Teresa
				ChocolaTess says

			Unsalted butter will make cookies flat... I made chocolate chip cookies over the holidays.... one recipe I used regular soft stick butter and second time I did unsalted butter... one batch was fluffy.. and the unsalted ones came out flat... did the unsalted ones because my husband recently had a heart attack..
				Cat says			
			June 16, 2016 at 10:40 am		
			Hi! I have a quick question, at what temperature do I put on the oven? And do I turn the oven on from up and down? or just down? or just up? XD I have an electric oven so I suffer a little when baking.. So if you can help that'll be great
				ChocolaTess says			
			June 16, 2016 at 11:48 am		
			Hi Cat! Your oven should be pre-heated at 350 degrees before you start baking. Turning the oven up or down? I'm not sure what you mean, but if you are talking about a dial, it's usually turned right or if it's digital you would go up until you reached 350.  I hope that helps? If not, let me know further what you need ok? 🙂

			This is my go-to cookie recipe!  I have so many compliments on them.  Only complaint.... they are gone as soon as I make them!  I usually have to double this recipe.  🙂
				ChocolaTess says			
			July 17, 2016 at 2:43 pm		
			Kristin, I definitely feel your pain.I do the same! (Besides eating twice as many as I should.)   🙂
				Danah says			
			July 25, 2016 at 3:48 pm		
			These are honestly THE BEST cookies I've ever made in my life! Your tips for chilling the dough and having the butter at room temperature changed everything. They are so perfectly soft on the inside and golden on the outside. Even brought them over to my boyfriend's grandma's for dinner and she even approved! Thanks for sharing (:
				ChocolaTess says			
			July 25, 2016 at 6:56 pm		
			Danah, if grandma approves, that says alot! 🙂 LOL!  Thank you for sharing your story and I'm so glad you liked the tips and they turned out so "Perfect". Keep on baking!
				Willians says			
			August 5, 2016 at 6:29 pm		
			Can I use self rising flour And what if I wanted no chocolate chips would I follow  the same recipe ?
				ChocolaTess says			
			August 5, 2016 at 7:20 pm		
			I would think you could, they might be a little puffier, since the recipe does not use baking powder. Yes you could leave the chocolate chips out. 🙂  Hope you enjoy Willians!

			Hi ChocolaTess! Thanks for this recipe, my family loves it as it was just right for our taste, good as it was not that's sweet. We liked how it was a good blend of crunch on the first bite but still very gooey for the kids and adults to enjoy. I just have to cook my two batches for about 14 minutes, made about 20 medium sized cookies. I bet this would just last a day in our house. Thanks again!
				ChocolaTess says			
			January 16, 2017 at 10:49 am		
			Hi Mom and Chelsea and Caleb!<3 These cookies do not last long, that is for sure! So glad you are enjoying them! 🙂
				Marci says			
			January 25, 2017 at 9:10 pm		
			These cookies are amazing! Probably the best I've ever made. I thought they might bring dry and crumbly when I first scooped them out, but the texture is just the right amount of moist on the inside! I'm definitely saving this recipe!
				ChocolaTess says

			The only chocolate chip cookie recipe I ever use is one my Aunt Vicki gave me years and years ago, it is the absolute best choc. chip cookie I have ever had. Until today. I mean, these cookies are something out of a dream. Sorry, Aunt Vicki. :p

			I just pulled these out of the oven, a new oven that I'm still figuring out. As I was preheating I prayed to the gods of chocolate and baked goods that they would deem me worthy and not condemn my offering to the pit of burned morsels.
The gods saw fit to smile upon me and I have to say these are some pretty dang amazing cookies! Thanks for sharing!
				ChocolaTess says

			Made a double batch tonight. Came out wonderfully. Kids loved them.
I think I'll make this my go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies. So good!
Thank you!
				ChocolaTess says			
			April 9, 2017 at 9:20 pm		
			Awesome Jessica!! I love hearing that! 🙂  Thanks for letting me know!
				Erin says

			Hello, this recipe looks awesome! I'm planning to double the recipe and make them for Teacher Appreciation week this week. Can I make the dough ahead and let it chill overnight? Thanks in advance for the info!
				ChocolaTess says			
			May 1, 2017 at 1:15 pm		
			Hi Erin! Yes you can, but allow a couple more minutes for baking, if the dough is refrigerated.  🙂  I'm sure the teachers will love them!!
				Jane says			
			May 9, 2017 at 5:51 pm		
			I almost didn't make these only because the first half of the comments were...must try, look so good, need to make these, etc etc etc. It wasn't til I got about half way through that I actually found reviews from people that had bothered to try it before commenting....sorry but that is a HUGE pet peeve of mine! I used half butter and half margarine only because I didn't have enough of either. I doubled the batch easily! And since I didn't have anywhere close to the amount of chocolate chips in the house for a spur of the moment baking day I used a pack of mini M&M's that I bought for Christmas baking and never used. I got 52 average size cookies and they were perfect at 10 minute baking time. These are VERY good cookies and I'm sure I will make them again!  Maybe next time I'll toss in some cinnamon and raisins to switch it up a bit too lol
				ChocolaTess says			
			May 9, 2017 at 6:20 pm		
			Hi Jane!  Thank you for sharing your experience and your substitutions for others if they get in a pinch.  I like your idea of cinnamon and raisin too!  So yummy!!
				Heather says

			I made these cookies today, only replacing ingredients with allergy safe ones.  They turned out amazing!!!! I used a rice flour blend for the flour, dairy free butter, dairy free chocolate chips, and flax seed for the egg.  Not all cookie recipes turn out when changing ingredients to allergy safe ones, or may not taste as good, but these were AMAZING!!!  Thought I would share for others who may have to use replacement ingredients due to allergies.
				ChocolaTess says			
			May 15, 2017 at 5:28 pm		
			Awesome! Your helpful modifications will definitely be handy for anyone that is looking for an allergy-free alternative for these chocolate chip cookies. Thank you so much for sharing Heather!! I appreciate that so much and no guesswork for others! 🙂 SA-Weet!

			BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever made, and believe me, I've experimented with everything from cookbook recipes to the back of the chocolate chip bag.  Soft, chewy, buttery, 5-star taste.  I used 62% dark chocolate chunks and cut them down to 1 cup and these cookies were perfect.  Thanks so much for sharing.

				Jane says			
			July 5, 2017 at 6:16 pm		
			The perfect cookie. This is just like a recepie my mother had and I won a blue ribbon at the fair in 1982,  for these. The only thing I do different is instead of 1 tsp b soda. I use 1/2 tsp b soda and mix with 1/2 tsp of b powder.  Excellent!
				ChocolaTess says

I used 1.75 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips and .75 cups milk chocolate chips.
Yum yum

				Tess says			
			July 26, 2017 at 1:14 pm		
			Perfection!! So yummy and they are beautiful!  I didn't have baking soda so I did a little research on Google and said I could use baking powder just triple the amount I wanted to try these cookies so desperately I use baking powder 3 teaspoons and they turned out magnificently. Oh and I had some white chips left over from another project so I tossed those in. This is now my only chocolate chip cookie recipe! Thank you thank you thank you!!
				ChocolaTess says			
			July 26, 2017 at 4:01 pm

			YES! You're not kidding when you say the perfect chocolate chip cookies, these are absolutely wonderful. My family could not get enough of them. Definitely will be my ONLY chocolate chip cookie recipe. I used dark chocolate chips... so yummy!

			Hi
I thought room temp butter was softened butter.
				ChocolaTess says			
			August 7, 2017 at 9:41 pm		
			Hi Jackie, they are different, room temp is where you can press you fingertip into the butter but your finger doesn't slide through.  Softened butter you would be able to do that.  Hope that helps?  You need to make these!! 😀
				Sofia says			
			August 9, 2017 at 9:00 pm		
			How many cookies does this recipe make? Thank you. 🙂
				ChocolaTess says

			15 to 30 depending how large or small you make them Sofia.

			Total rookie with anything made from scratch. I usually just take and bake. About to make my 2nd attempt with these. Used too floor last time and basically made muffin cookies. They were good though and everyone gobbled them up. Hopefully I get it right this time. Love the recipe though, thanks! 👍
				ChocolaTess says			
			August 15, 2017 at 9:10 am		
			I'm so proud of you for trying it and wanting to give it a go again!!  You can do it Chacha!  Thank you so much for letting me know your experience!
				Sarah says			
			August 16, 2017 at 11:41 am		
			These are actually THE BEST chocolate chip cookies! I have made them many times, but the first time I made them I overcooked them because I thought they didn't look done enough at 8 minutes. The second time I made them I took them out right at 8 minutes, which was absolutely perfect and how I cook them every time! The shorter you cook them the better!:)
				Nichole says			
			August 16, 2017 at 7:23 pm		
			These are seriously the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made in my life. The best! Follow instructions to a T and you will get the BEST cookies EVER!

			Hi! I'm no Betty Crocker! And every time I bake cookies from scratch they turn out too fluffy and I swear I'm reading word for word on the directions. So I came across your recipe and again I followed word for word. But after mixing the flour in, and tossed in the chocolate chips, I feel like the dough looked too doughy, like sorta sticky, does that make sense? I have the dough sitting in fridge to chill like your tip says. But I'm scared they will come out fluffy again.. any tips?
				ChocolaTess says			
			August 16, 2017 at 8:59 pm		
			Hi Liz, it should be a little doughy but scoopable. As long as you didn't overmix and you measured correctly you should be fine.  Try it and see how it goes and let me know.  😀

			Best cookie ive ever had! Seriously! 
I Made quite a bit of changes though.
I added 1 1/2 Tbl spoon of powdered milk. (I read it makes the cookies chewy) I subbed half the white sugar with powdered stevia.
Added 1 Tbl of molasses.
Added 1/2 tsp of maple extract
Subbed 1/2 cup of the flour with toasted oats.
I used white whole wheat flour instead all purpose flour.
I also browned half of the butter.
For choco chips I used white choco chip,
Semi sweet choco chip and crushed Cadbury milk chocolate eggs.
I refrigerated the dough for 24 hours.
Baked at 380.
Made 4 LARGE cookies.
They where ooy-good in the center and crispy around the edges. Absolutely DELIGHTFUL!
With my adjustments THIS IS THE BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE RECIPE!

			These cookies are amazing. I had to freeze them so I wouldn't eat them all myself but even frozen they're great! Put a little vanilla ice cream between two of them and they're divine! We will definitely be making these again in the near future.
				ChocolaTess says

				Christie says			
			September 15, 2017 at 7:42 am		
			These cookies are delicious! My son is egg allergic, so I used an egg substitute (water/oil/baking powder), and they still came out perfectly. I also only used about half of the chocolate chips. Still delicious!
				ChocolaTess says			
			September 15, 2017 at 10:49 am		
			Thank you for sharing Christie!  I know there are lots of people with egg allergies or gluten free and substitutes seem to work great in these cookies! Have a wonderful weekend!
				Gemma says			
			September 17, 2017 at 4:00 pm		
			Yes!  I've finally found a recipe for chocolate chip cookies that are exactly like I like them. I love how they stay puffy instead of spreading, and are SO full of chips.  I followed the instructions to the letter, and mine look just like yours. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

			First off...I don't think there is such a thing as "too many chocolate chips"! I made these and they were awesome! I also forwarded the recipe to my daughter (fairly new baker who has suffered some chocolate chip cookie disasters) and they came out perfect for her also! She was so happy!! Thanks for an awesome go-to recipe!
				ChocolaTess says			
			October 7, 2017 at 4:03 pm

			I'm not sure how many cookie recipes claim to be the most "perfect," but I promise this one is the real deal. Follow the instructions to a T. It is seriously a science to make the "perfect" cookies, lol. They are AMAZING. Hands down the BEST chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. Again as the recipe says...ROOM TEMP BUTTER AND CHILLING THE DOUGH IS CRUCIAL. They do not come out the same without!

				Stephanie says			
			October 19, 2017 at 11:34 pm		
			These came out SO GOOD. I used 1.25 c whole wheat flower, and 0.25 c almond meal, and dark brown sugar. I also used 1 cup Guittard milk chocolate and 1 cup Guittard dark chocolate chips! A great combo. After making the dough i left it in the fridge for about 30 minutes. Needed about 14 minutes to cook with big cookies. I made 17 total. As a warning, if you use dark brown sugar and whole wheat flower its more difficult to see the edges browning so make sure to cook an eye on them! I overcooked the first batch by about a minute thirty. 
Really great recipe: nice, thick, chewy cookies with just enough chocolate (a lot!)..
				ChocolaTess says			
			October 20, 2017 at 10:40 am		
			Great to know Stephanie!  Great tips for sure! Thank you so much for those, I love using 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 whole flour, but good to know about the almond flour and other info you have provided. 😀  Happy Friday and cheers to yummy cookies!
				IvonNe says			
			October 22, 2017 at 6:56 pm		
			Hi! I really liked this recipe but the only thing I would change, for my next batch, would be to use less chocolate chips. I found that the cookies had too many chocolate chips, for my taste, and I only used 2 cups instead of the 2 1/4 cups the recipe called for. I'll try 1 1/2 cups next time and see how that goes. Otherwise, the cookies are delicious and I was happy I used my Kitchaid stand mixer for it. One bowl and less to clean up, it was great!
				ChocolaTess says			
			October 23, 2017 at 8:04 am		
			Thank you, my husband likes less chocolate chips as well. So it is whatever your preference is. So glad you enjoyed them Ivonne!

			I'm so glad I found this recipe. Had a midnight craving for cookies but not already made cookies. I've had bad luck with a lot of chocolate chip recipes. This turned out perfectly. I didn't have vanilla extract which is strange.. somehow I have a lot of mint extract, though I wasn't brave enough to use it. These turned out exactly how I've been trying to make cookies. I'm ashamed to say how many years it took me. Perfect recipe!
				ChocolaTess says			
			October 31, 2017 at 5:30 pm		
			Kas that is so awesome! I'm so glad you found this recipe to bring you here and you decided to give this recipe a try.  For the holidays, if you like mint, use a half or whole teaspoon, I'm sure they'll be wonderful! 😀

			I helped host a bridal shower for my best friend yesterday. I couldn't find the original recipe I wanted to use, so I found yours on Pinterest (mainly b/c I had all of the ingredients). They were self- and husband-aproved, but the kicker was that the little old ladies though they were the best chocolate cookies they ever had! They wouldn't stop talking about it. One even came up to me at the end of the shower and said she went back and took two more for herself!
Definitely saving this recipe and using it for a long time to come!
				ChocolaTess says

I bet no one here"s ever had such mouth-watring yummy cookies. I used saltless magerine and it just took a little longer in the oven to bake, but they came out excellent! Thanks again for this priceless recipe!

			I just made these last night and they are amazing!!! My boyfriend loved them. I used semi-sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, and butterscotch chips and they came out so good. I also added some sea salt at the end because I wanted them sweet and salty. Such a great and easy recipe. I'm never buying pre-made dough again!
				ChocolaTess says			
			November 23, 2017 at 10:02 am
